## About The Project

Logline Security is a personalized cybersecurity news aggregator, designed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to serve security professionals, students, and enthusiasts.

Its core value is to save users time by consolidating news from trusted sources into a single, intelligent platform, providing a customized and relevant threat intelligence feed.

*Currently optimized for Desktop, mobile access will still work but will have some minor visual bugs.*

### Core Features:

* **Automated Content Pipeline:** A daily, serverless function scrapes articles from multiple high-profile news sites, uses the Azure OpenAI service to intelligently categorize them, and curates a list of top "featured" stories.
* **Personalized Dashboard:** After a secure login using Microsoft Entra ID, users can check categories they want to follow allowing them to filter their dashbard for those categories
* **User Engagement Tools:** The app includes essential features like the ability to save favorite articles for later reading, a robust search function, and opt-in email notifications for new content in followed categories.
